Experiments to test difference between using the normalized and combinatorial Laplacian in the agglomeration phase.

*comb files and normLap
========================
Network agglomerated as Eagg/ Nagg
50 repetitions

*Eagg files 
========================
Network agglomerated as Eagg only
50 repetitions

*Eagg sqrt files
========================
Network agglomerated as Eagg / sqrt(Nagg)
50 repetitions
